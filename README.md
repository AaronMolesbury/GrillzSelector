# GrillzSelector

*Originally designed for TripleSixJewels https://www.triplesixjewels.com/*

This is a custom HTML Element designed for the purpose of being an interactive visual for an E-Commerce store selling Grillz. 

The idea is to give customers a simple interface in which they can get a simple visual representation of the jewellery in terms of looks, positioning etc.

### Usage
To add this interface to your project simply 
- add the `Denture.js` to your project's `src/*` directory
- import the script into html (e.g. `<script src="src/Denture.js"></script>`)
- reference the custom element in HTML using the `<denture-element>` (this can be renamed to anything in the final line of `Denture.js`

The element comes with a simple dropdown selector which allows the user to select the type of tooth. In the current version only Silver and Gold Grillz are availale to preview. 

The code has been designed with expansion in mind so I've tried to make it as easy as possible to introduce new Tooth styles and integrate the project to a live E-Commerce site. The goal is to also link the customer's Grill selection via the interface to the store's products to enhance the customer's online shopping experience.

The code is currently a basic implementation but feel free to fork and hack.

### Test
Anyone can test the interface by forking this repo and openning `index.html`.
